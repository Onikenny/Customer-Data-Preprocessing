# Customer-Data-Preprocessing

This project is the processing of data from a company's customer records for business purposes (acw_user_data.csv). The task is to prepare this data for further analysis by including representation changes, filtering, and deriving some new attributes / metrics for them. 
The data include attributes such as first name, second name, credit card number, marital status, and even contains data on the customerâ€™s car. 

Pre-processing is achieved using standard python (No pandas / seaborn) with default libraries 

Raw data file is accessible at [acw_user_data.csv](https://github.com/Onikenny/Customer-Data-Preprocessing/files/7925066/acw_user_data.csv)
